## ✨ Features

*   🎯 **Intelligent Name Parsing**: Automatically extracts one or more names from target folder names (e.g., "John Smith" or "Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy").
*   🔍 **Recursive File Scanning**: Deep-scans a source directory and all its subdirectories to find every file that needs sorting.
*   🤖 **Smart Matching Logic**: Matches files to target folders by checking if the filename contains any associated name variants.
*   🛡️ **Pre-run Safety Checks**: Detects duplicate names across target folders and asks for user confirmation before proceeding, preventing incorrect sorting.
*   🤝 **Interactive Conflict Resolution**: If a file already exists at the destination, it provides clear choices:
    *   **Rename**: Move the new file with a suffix (e.g., `file_duplicate_001.txt`).
    *   **Skip**: Do not move the file.
    *   **Rename All**: Automate renaming for all future conflicts in the session.
*   🤔 **Ambiguity Resolution**: If a file matches multiple folders, it helps you decide:
    *   Choose the correct destination from a smartly sorted list.
    *   Skip the current file or all future ambiguous files.
*   ℹ️ **Built-in Help**: Get a quick overview of commands and options right from the terminal with the `-h` flag.
*   🧪 **Built-in Test Data Generator**: Quickly set up a test environment with a single command.

## 🚀 How It Works

The utility follows a simple and powerful workflow to organize your digital clutter.

## 💡 Use Cases

| **For...** | **Use Case** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accountants & Lawyers** | Sort client documents into individual folders. | `Invoice - John Doe.pdf` → `\John Doe\` |
| **Photographers** | Organize photoshoots by client or event name. | `Emily & David Wedding-001.jpg` → `\Emily & David Wedding\` |
| **Researchers** | Arrange papers and data by author or study. | `Analysis by Dr. Smith.xlsx` → `\Dr. Smith\` |
| **Personal Use** | Clean up a messy "Downloads" folder. | `Vacation Photo (Anna).png` → `\Anna\` |

## Prerequisites

*   .NET 9 SDK or later.

## Usage

This section covers two ways to use the utility: running a pre-compiled release and building from source.

### Command-line Options

| Option | Alias | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `<target_path> <source_path>` | | The main arguments specifying the target and source directories. |
| `--setup-test-data` | | Generates a set of test folders and files. |
| `--help` | `-h` | Displays the help screen with usage information. |

### 1. Using a Pre-compiled Release (Recommended)

This is the easiest way for most users.

1.  Go to the project's **Releases** page.
2.  Download the latest version for your operating system (e.g., `file-sorter-win-x64.zip`).
3.  Extract the archive to a convenient location.
4.  Open a terminal in that folder and run the executable, passing the required arguments.

**On Windows:**
```bash
.\file_sort.exe "<path_to_target_folders>" "<path_to_source_files>"
```

**On Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./file_sort "<path_to_target_folders>" "<path_to_source_files>"
```

### 2. Building from Source

This method is for developers who want to modify the code.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shtormish/file_sort.git
    cd file_sort
    ```
2.  Build the application. This command will create an executable in the `bin/Release/net9.0/` directory:
    ```bash
    dotnet build -c Release
    ```
3.  Run the compiled application:

    **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    .\bin\Release\net9.0\file_sort.exe "<path_to_target_folders>" "<path_to_source_files>"
    ```

    **On Linux/macOS:**
    ```bash
    ./bin/Release/net9.0/file_sort "<path_to_target_folders>" "<path_to_source_files>"
    ```

    Alternatively, for quick development and testing, you can use the `dotnet run` command:
    ```bash
    dotnet run -- "<path_to_target_folders>" "<path_to_source_files>"
    ```

### Generating Test Data

To create the `temp1` (targets) and `temp2` (sources) directories for testing, run the application with the `--setup-test-data` flag.

> **Note:** The double dash `--` is necessary to ensure the argument is passed to the application and not interpreted by the `dotnet` command itself.

```bash
dotnet run -- --setup-test-data
```

## Debugging

*   **Paths**: Ensure that all directory paths are correct. If a path contains spaces, it must be enclosed in double quotes (`"`).
*   **Console Output**: The application provides detailed, real-time feedback in the console for every operation: scanning, moving, skipping, and any conflicts or ambiguities encountered.
*   **Error Messages**: Clear error messages are printed for common issues such as missing directories or file system access errors (e.g., insufficient permissions).

## Disclaimer

This application was developed with the assistance of the AI coding assistant **Gemini Code Assist**. While the code has been carefully reviewed, users should exercise their own judgment and test the software thoroughly before using it in a production or critical environment.
